# Network Analysis

The famous motto - Correlation does not imply causality - keeps haunting economists, especially when it comes to the identification and estimation of peer effects in social networks. On one hand, similarities (either on micro or macro-level) begets friendship. On the other hand, the interaction or formation of friendship within social network also affect behaviors of agents. A perfect way to identify and estimate the peer effects is to run a random experiment that can isolate the peer effects from other factors. However, this is not feasible in the real world.

With the dataset called Panel Study of Cologne Gymnasium Students (KGP), I try to model the identification and estimation of peer effects with structural examination of network formation.
